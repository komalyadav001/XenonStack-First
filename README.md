3.Save the Manual Page:
After writing the content, save the file in the text editor (for nano, press Ctrl + O to write out the file and Ctrl + X to exit).
4.Move the Manual Page to the man Directory:
 Move the manual page file (internsctl.1) to the appropriate man directory for user commands (e.g., /usr/share/man/man1/).
